# Reflection: Week One
-----------------------

__Thoughts On Digital History__

Prior to starting this course, I've never heard the term "*digital history*". So if you had asked me a couple weeks ago what I thought digital history was, my answer would have been along the lines of "*historical documents that have been uploaded to the internet*." probably stated as a question. Although my assumption isn't technically wrong, throughout this past week I've learnt that digital history is __so much more than that__.

 From the readings this week I've learnt that digital history doesn't really have any limitations to what it is. It can be used to share personal history, stories of a town, a group of people, the forgotten voices, as well as the big events. The overall feeling I got from the readings is that digital history allows for people to be more creative and expressive with what they are researching, teaching/ sharing. I believe that digital history is interactive, it’s about thinking outside the box, sky is the limit basically. I feel like digital history and public history are closely related and intertwined. Whereas, *for a lack of a better word*, traditional history study is more about the main events, the more important, or interesting things in history. In digital history you can focus in on anything and everything you want. If a voice is missing, you can do the research, find out as much as you can about the topic and create a cite to educate others who might be interested, or allow for other historians to contribute to the growing knowledge.

 I like the idea that more research is being done on things that are meaningful and impactful to people whose stories aren't told as often.

 _That is my interpretation of the field at least_.

**Digital Silence**

While it seems there are many groups of people who are facing digital silence out there, I found the twitter tread by _Amalia S. Levi_ particularly interesting. She mentions “archival silence” stating that “**_most people appreciate the easiness of online access to archival material but tend to forget that all digitization is selective._**"<sup>1</sup> I don’t think I have ever thought about the fact that the primary documents that I’m seeing online, may not be complete, that there may be more of the document, or things that go along side it, but were not digitized. Or simply things could have been omitted from the source. From what I’ve gathered throughout the readings, is that there a lot of voices and pieces of history that are missing. It’ll be interesting to over time see some of these things come to light and hopefully, finally get a more accurate look at history.

An article from Levi's Twitter tread I really enjoyed was _The Early Caribbean Digital Archive_. In the ECDA, they are "remixing and reassembling"<sup>2</sup> stories of slaves they have found throughout the written works of European colonial's. As any historian would know, colonization often has a way of replacing the local's history with their own version. The ECDA is one of the many organizations trying decolonize history, to add those missing voices back into their own histories.

__Excitement and Direction__

I am most excited about seeing and learning history being taught in a different way than I'm used to. I am **very** passionate about history (_the topics and periods i like anyways_) however, after almost three years of study, it gets tedious and almost discouraging to be doing the same things over and over. *__Essays on top of essays.__* I'm excited to learn something new and *hopefully* learn a valuable skill. That being how to use a computer for things other than surfing the internet and online shopping. _Which is pretty much **all** I know how to do at the moment._
