# Reflection: Week One

### Thoughts On Digital History

Prior to starting this course, I've never heard the term "*digital history*". So if you had asked me a couple weeks ago what I thought digital history was, my answer would have been along the lines of "*historical documents that have been uploaded to the internet*." Simple as that. Although my assumption isn't technically wrong, throughout this past week I've learnt that digital history is __so much more than that__. 

 From the readings this week I've learnt that digital history doesn't really have any limitations to what it is. It can be used to share personal history, stories of a town, a group of people, the forgotten voices, as well as the big events. Digital history is interactive. There are sights run by professors and historians that allow students to research and contribute along side them, giving them credit for their work and experience for their futures. While this can be done at Universities and out in the real world as well, these spots are much more limited. Digital history gives students and historians the opportunity to find something that interests them specifically to work on. _that is my interpretation of the field at least_.
